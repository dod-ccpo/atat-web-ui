      The Order section of an interagency agreement within G-Invoicing replaces the FS Form 7600B.
      It identifies the specific Requesting Agency requirements for the expected delivery of
      products and/or services by the Servicing Agency. A fiscal obligation is created when all
      required points of contact sign to authorize the Order.

      A GT&C agreement may contain one or more Orders.
