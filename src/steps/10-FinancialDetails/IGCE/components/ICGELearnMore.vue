    <h2 class="mb-5">What is an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)?</h2>
    <p>
      An IGCE is the estimated price of an anticipated contracting effort for budget purposes, 
      based solely on the requirements. It is the Government’s estimate of the resources and 
      projected cost/price of those resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      An IGCE should mirror the performance requirements outlined in the Description of Work 
      as much as possible. It is an important document that assists the Contracting Officer in 
      determining the reasonableness of an offeror’s proposed price and understanding of the 
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An IGCE can be calculated using pricing tools provided by each Cloud Service Provider 
      (CSP), as well as prior historical rates and information. It should include a detailed 
      breakdown of estimates for cloud services, support packages, and travel. Although one 
      or more CSP’s pricing tools may be utilized in development of the IGCE, the actual 
      requirement will be competed amongst all CSPs (unless an exception to fair opportunity 
      is approved).
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be as accurate as possible. An overestimated IGCE may result in an over commitment 
      of funds and a distorted understanding of requirements; an underestimated estimate can  
      result in too little funding committed, delays due to an iterative proposal process, 
      and other internal administrative problems.
