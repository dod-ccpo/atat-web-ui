                An incremental funding plan provides the contracting office with assurance that
                funds have been budgeted and will be available to fully fund all non-optional
                services on a projected schedule.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-2">
                To incrementally fund a task order, the period of performance must be at least 9
                months. Based on what you previously told us, this contracting effort requires a
                [X-month] base period.
              </p>
