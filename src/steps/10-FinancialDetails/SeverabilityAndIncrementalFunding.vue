            To request incremental funding, your requirement must be severable in nature. This means
            that it can be divided and apportioned into two or more parts that are not necessarily
            dependent upon each other. If you select Yes below, we will help you generate a
            projected schedule for your incremental funding next.

                Severable services are continuing and recurring in nature (e.g., systems development
                support provided on a level-of-effort basis). "Severable" means tasks can be
                separated into components that independently meet a separate and on-going need of
                the government.
              </p>
              <p>
                U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) considers services to be non-severable
                when they constitute an entire job or single undertaking with a defined end-product
                that cannot feasibly be subdivided for separate performance in each fiscal year.
                GAO's Principles of Federal Appropriations Law presents a contract to conduct a
                study and prepare a final report as an example of non-severable services and
                concludes that non-severable services must be funded entirely out of the
                appropriation current at the time of award, notwithstanding that performance may
                extend into future fiscal years. Following that logic, GAO has further determined
                that contracts for non-severable services cannot be incrementally funded.
