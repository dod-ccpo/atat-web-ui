          An evaluation plan is used to establish the basis for how your
          acquisition will be evaluated during the source selection process.
        </p>
        <p id="SecondP">
          Since your requirement qualifies for an exception to the fair
          opportunity process, your evaluation team will assess the CSP’s entire
          solicitation response for technical acceptability. A task order award
          will be issued on a sole-source basis to the CSP that you specified in
          the previous section.
