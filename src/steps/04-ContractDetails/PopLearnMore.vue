      Understanding Periods of Performance (PoP) for task orders on the JWCC contract
    </h2>
    <p> 
      A requested PoP should be from the date of award through XX years/months/days 
      after date of award, with XX option periods (e.g. one-year base period with 
      four one-year option periods).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following guidelines should be used when determining the PoP for task orders 
      on the JWCC contract:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A single base and/or option period cannot exceed one year.
      </li>
      <li>
        The PoP, including the base and all option periods, cannot exceed five years.
      </li>
      <li>
        A task order cannot extend more than one year after the expiration date of 
        the JWCC contract. However, option periods may be exercised after the 
        expiration date.
      </li>
    </ul>

          In the event that a JWCC contract option period is not exercised or is 
          terminated/canceled prior to the end of the last anticipated option period 
          in the JWCC contract schedule, any current task ordersâ€™ terms and conditions 
          will be unaffected.
