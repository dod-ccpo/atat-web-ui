              How does FOIA impact my acquisition package?

            <template v-slot:content>
              <p>
                Generally, the work statements describe the government’s requirements 
                and are in the public domain prior to award, having been disclosed to 
                offerors as part of the Request for Quote/Proposal.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a work statement contains information that has not been given a 
                security classification under the criteria of an Executive Order, but 
                the disclosure of which would be considered harmful to a government 
                interest, one or more FOIA exemptions may apply. In this instance, 
                the work statement/DD254 should be marked for Controlled Unclassified 
                Information (CUI) and each paragraph that contains CUI information 
                should also be marked to alert the recipient that an exemption may apply.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Responsibility for the marking of CUI information is with the mission 
                owner. The CUI legend ensures that a recipient is aware of the status 
                of the information in the document; it is not a form of classification 
                to protect security interests.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                FOIA mandates that releasable information be segregated from exempted 
                information within a document; an entire document cannot be exempted 
                if only a portion is considered vulnerable to a security risk. A document 
                marked CUI in its entirety, but wherein the information is not segregated 
                as set out above, will be referred to the mission owner’s FOIA office for 
                response to the FOIA requester. The contracting office can only protect 
                from disclosure of a document that has been appropriately marked when it 
                is submitted as part of a complete requirements package.
