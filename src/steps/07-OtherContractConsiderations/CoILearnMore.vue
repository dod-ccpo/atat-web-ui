      Understanding Conflicts of Interest (COI)

        <span class="_external-link">FAR 9.502</span>
      </a> states that “an organizational COI may result when factors create an 
      actual or potential COI on an instant contract, or when 
      the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an 
      actual or potential COI on a future acquisition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      An organizational COI exists when the nature of the work to be performed 
      may, without some restriction on future activities:
      <ol>
        <li>result in an 
      unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on other contracts, or</li>
      <li>impair the contractor’s objectivity in performing the contract work.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In services contracts, it is the latter which may most often occur because 
      of a contractor’s access to proprietary information, the evaluation and 
      analysis of products which it may produce, and/or its role as an advocate 
      in contract performance or other situations.

      Who is responsible for identifying COI?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The primary burden is on the contractor to identify any organizational 
      COI; however, the government has the responsibility to identify and 
      evaluate such conflicts. The Contracting Officer (KO) is 
      charged with avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating such potential 
      conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customer must make a determination that no COI exists, or identify 
      any potential COI that may exist for the execution of this task order. 
      The customer should request approval from their KO if a competitive 
      requirement, which is similar to the work on this Description of Work is 
      contemplated by their agency.
