                  As a Mission Partner, it is your responsibility to obtain 
                  the appropriate agreements with your business associate(s). 
                  Business associates must also obtain BAAs from their subcontractors. 
                  These agreements shall be maintained by your office and are not included 
                  in your acquisition package.

                  Per HIPAA, a BAA is required when PHI is transmitted and maintained in electronic 
                  or any other form and in combination with one or more of the 18 
                  identifiers defined by HIPAA.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Government strives to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and 
                  availability of e-PHI by permitting a business associate to create, 
                  receive, maintain, or transmit e-PHI on its behalf; this is the case 
                  only if there is written agreement between the Mission Partner and 
                  the business associate that provides assurance that the business 
                  associate will appropriately safeguard the e-PHI. Business associate 
                  must also obtain same business associate agreements from its subcontractors.
