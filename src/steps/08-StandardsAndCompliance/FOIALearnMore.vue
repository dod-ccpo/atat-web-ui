    <h2 class="mb-5">Understanding the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</h2>
    <p> 
      Since 1967, the FOIA has provided the public the right to request access to records 
      from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the 
      know about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any information 
      requested under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions which protect 
      interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FOIA also requires agencies to proactively post online certain categories of 
      information, including frequently requested records. As Congress, the President, 
      and the Supreme Court have all recognized, the FOIA is a vital part of our democracy.
