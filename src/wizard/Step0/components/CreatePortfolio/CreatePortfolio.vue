        Hi {{ user.given_name }}, let’s create your first portfolio!

      <p>
        To get started with provisioning your cloud resources, you will need to
        set up a portfolio. We will walk you through adding your contract
        information, as well as establishing the workspaces and team members
        that will develop your provisioned applications within the CSP console.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need to have an approved task order to fund your project, prior
        to completing your portfolio submission. But don't worry, you can save a
        draft and come back to it at any time prior to provisioning. You can
        even invite other portfolio managers to help you out along the way!
      </p>
      <p>Let’s get started!</p>
